# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This is my portfolio website, built using React and Vite. I created this site to provide recruiters with an overview of my skills and an easy way to contact me regarding potential job opportunities.

The project leverages several technologies:

React and Vite: These frameworks were chosen for their performance, popularity, and frequent use in modern development. Using Vite with React allowed me to create a fast, responsive Single Page Application (SPA).
CSS: Used for styling the website's layout and components to ensure an appealing and user-friendly design.
Getform: Integrated into the contact section for backend functionality, enabling recruiters to send messages directly to my email.

This project helped me enhance my skills in building dynamic, visually appealing web applications while also exploring the integration of frontend and backend tools.
